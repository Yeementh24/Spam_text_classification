Feature Extraction In NLP, Training ,Evaluating,Testing

Need of feature extraction techniques Machine Learning algorithms learn from a pre-defined set of features from the training data to produce output for the test data. But the main problem in working with language processing is that machine learning algorithms cannot work on the raw text directly. So, we need some feature extraction techniques to convert text into a matrix(or vector) of features. Some of the most popular methods of feature extraction are :

- N-Gram, Bi-Gram etc
- Bag of Words (BoW)
- Term Frequency Calculation TF
- Inverse Document Frequency IDF
- TFIDF Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency
- Text Classification
